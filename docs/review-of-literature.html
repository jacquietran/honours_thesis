<div id="introduction-to-accelerometer-technology" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Introduction to accelerometer technology</h2>
<p>A range of acceleration sensors exist, including strain gauge, piezoresistive, and capacitive (40), though the most common form of technology employed is the piezoelectric acceleration sensor (12, 40). These units utilize a piezoelectric element and a seismic mass within an enclosure (12). When the unit undergoes acceleration, the seismic mass causes the piezoelectric element to deform, causing displaced charge to build up on one side of the sensor, which generates a voltage signal that is proportional to the acceleration experienced by the unit (12, 66).</p>
<div id="acceleration-data-collection-and-filtering" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Acceleration data collection and filtering</h3>
<p>Accelerometers measure acceleration, or the change in velocity over time (33, 72). This data is often reported in gravitational acceleration (g) values, where 1 g is equal to the acceleration of the body due to the force of gravity acting on it (-9.8 m.s-2) (12, 40, 72). Data may demonstrate positive acceleration or negative acceleration (more commonly referred to as “deceleration”). In physical activity contexts, data is often reported in activity counts, which are derived from accelerations through a process called “data filtering” (12). The manufacturer or user can define data cutoff points, such that all data within this range is given full weighting (e.g., 1 activity count = weighting of 1.0), and any data that falls outside this range, is given a lower weighting (less than 1.0) or is filtered out to reduce the number of counts that are not representative of the actual movement of interest (e.g., “activity” recorded if a unit shifts in its place) (7). In sporting environments, peak acceleration values corresponding with specific movement events are of greater interest than overall activity counts.</p>
</div>
<div id="accelerometer-axes-and-orientation" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Accelerometer axes and orientation</h3>
<p>Accelerometers can be classified as uniaxial, biaxial, or triaxial. Uniaxial accelerometers measure acceleration in a single axis (when monitors are attached to human participants, this is usually aligned with the longitudinal axis, with respect to the ground) (50). Biaxial accelerometers measure acceleration in two axes (55, 75), but are not commonly used due to the emergence of more sophisticated triaxial configurations. Triaxial accelerometers measure acceleration in three axes (55), most commonly aligned with the sagittal, transverse, and longitudinal axes when human participants are instrumented (12). Triaxial accelerometers are becoming more popular in sports and exercise research, due to their capacity to measure three-dimensional accelerations which may potentially improve the accuracy of data quantifying various movements occurring in multiple planes (e.g., lifestyle activities) (71).</p>
</div>
<div id="sampling-rate" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> Sampling rate</h3>
<p>Although accelerometer sampling rates have been set as high as 3000 Hz in previous research (i.e., 3000 data points collected per second) (76), physical activity and sports researchers commonly use a sampling rate of 100 Hz (12). This allows 100 “pieces” of data to be collected per second. In addition, accelerometers can be configured to collect data in “epochs”, which are manufacturer- or user-defined periods of time during which activity counts can either be totaled (13) or averaged (12), varying with different models and manufacturers. This function is more often utilized in physical activity settings, where an individual’s energy cost over a period of days is of interest to the researcher (67). The setting of moderate-length epochs (commonly 1-minute) allows data collection to occur over consecutive days without exceeding the storage capacity of the monitors. In sports settings, data is usually recorded and downloaded in its raw format (raw acceleration data), without undergoing any filtering or compressing procedures.</p>
</div>
<div id="accelerometer-range" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.4</span> Accelerometer range</h3>
<p>Accelerometer range is important to consider in relation to the motion (human or mechanical) or event being tested. The sensing range of an accelerometer refers to the acceleration range over which a unit is capable of recording data, and is dependent on the accelerometer’s sensor technology (63). Piezoelectric accelerometers tend to be popular for this reason, as this technology allows for the measurement of high impact events (e.g., + 100 g or greater) (63). Accelerometers used to analyze human movement commonly range between + 2-10 g when used to quantify walking and running events (40), though higher ranges have been reported with varying unit placement [e.g., two +70 g uniaxial accelerometers used by Elvin et al. (21) to measure tibial axial accelerations].</p>

<div id="use-of-accelerometers-in-physical-activity-monitoring" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Use of accelerometers in physical activity monitoring</h2>
<p>Although it will not be the focus of this review, it is worth briefly examining accelerometers in physical activity due to their extensive use in field interventions and research, and the volume of research that has examined the validity of accelerometers as a physical activity measurement tool. Physical activity researchers use activity counts (derived from accelerometer data) to assess the duration, frequency, and intensity of physical activity (25, 50), and to estimate energy expenditure (12, 46, 50) in laboratory and free-living conditions. These units are particularly popular as they provide direct, objective measures of physical activity (2, 46), are cost-effective compared to other activity assessment techniques [e.g., doubly labelled water method (12)], are small in size (12, 71), and place minimal burden on participants (25, 58). Commonly, participants wear an accelerometer continuously over the course of 3-7 days (67), at either the hip or waist (50). As estimators of energy expenditure, accelerometers have been found to be valid when assessing level-ground and treadmill walking and running, but these monitors tend to be less accurate when assessing other lifestyle activities, such as those requiring predominantly upper body movements (73). Recently, researchers (25, 39) have investigated accelerometer validity in regards to quantifying loads experienced by the body during impact-based activities. The key findings from these studies will be discussed in further detail in section 2.4.</p>
</div>
<div id="use-of-accelerometers-in-sports-performance-analysis-and-injury-monitoring" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Use of accelerometers in sports performance analysis and injury monitoring</h2>
<p>Accelerometers are also popular as a performance analysis tool in elite sports (55), where it is often used to assess the physical demands of a session, supplying sport scientists with objective data to aid in the appropriate planning of recovery and training loads (19). This technology is also utilized in injury measurement (e.g., during head impacts) (4, 8, 18, 32, 51, 52, 62), quality testing of protective equipment (11, 38, 44, 65), and biomechanical assessment (31, 61, 68). As in physical activity, the portability of accelerometers is favourable in sport settings, permitting the measurement of movement in training and competition, where it is generally impractical (due to size, weight, and/or equipment design) to use other tools to take direct measures (such as force plates) (21).</p>
<div id="elite-sports-performance-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Elite sports performance analysis</h3>
<p>In elite sports, the use of accelerometers has grown rapidly in recent years, particularly in competitive team sports. Accelerometers are often integrated with GPS technology for use in many field team sports, as demonstrated by the prevalence of integrated GPS monitors currently used in the Australian Football League (10, 22), Australian National Rugby League (10, 35, 36, 42), A League Football (28), Professional Rugby Union and Super 14 Rugby (10, 28), and the English Premier League (10, 28). Despite the widespread application of such technology as reported by the manufacturer (28) and in general literature, there is a paucity of scientific literature acknowledging the use of GPS-integrated accelerometry in sports. Where GPS technology allows for the measurement of variables such as total distance run, time spent in various speed zones, and so on, accelerometers are used to log the frequency and intensity of “impact” events, such as tackles in Australian football (29). In addition, accelerometers record other physically-stressful (i.e., short-duration, high-intensity) events that require rapid changes in acceleration, such as sprinting, jumping and landing, and direction change movements (29). Though time-motion analysis studies have reported that high-intensity efforts represent only 2-6% of total game time in field team sports (15, 20, 64), these events are of interest to performance analysts and coaches alike for their contribution to the overall physical demand imposed on athletes (29), and their significance to competitive outcomes, given that these events often occur during crucial periods of a match (e.g., sprinting and changing direction to attack the try line in rugby) (64). For the purposes of this review, these common team sport movements requiring rapid acceleration and/or deceleration will be referred to collectively as impacts.
In quantifying impact events, acceleration data is used as an indirect measure of the force acting on the body in a certain direction. This approach is based on Newton’s Second Law of Motion (33, 57), which states that force (F) is equal to the product of an object’s mass (m) and the object’s acceleration (a), that is:</p>
<p>F = m x a</p>
<p>In an elite sporting environment, the athlete is the object. Over the short time period during which impact events occur, m remains constant [considering the body as a single mass particle (17)]. Therefore, force should be proportional to acceleration, thus providing the conceptual basis for using accelerometers in the field to indirectly assess force. Commonly, accelerometer data is used to identify the physical cost incurred by an athlete as a result of impact events experienced (42). This data has been used to monitor the frequency of impacts, and to calculate indices of physical demand such as “body load” (27). Increases in these variables indicate to the sport scientist that the athlete in question may require increased recovery time, decreased training load, or temporary cessation of activity (e.g., in-game substitutions) to rest and avoid injury (26). However, the validity of accelerometer data when used in this manner has not been widely investigated. Specifically, no literature has examined the integration of multiple technologies, such as the frequently utilized combination of GPS and accelerometry. Additionally, no studies have validated accelerometer data when such monitors are utilized in a similar manner to their use in field team sports settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="other-uses-in-sporting-contexts" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Other uses in sporting contexts</h3>
<p>Accelerometry-based monitors and multiple-monitor systems are often utilized for the purposes of injury measurement, quality testing of protective equipment, and injury research. Accelerometers have been used to assess head accelerations during impact events, occurring in actual and simulated gameplay, in sports such as soccer (51, 52, 62), field hockey (51), and American football (8, 18, 32, 51). Additionally, accelerometer technology is commonly used to assess the protective features of sporting equipment, especially protective headgear. The impact absorption characteristics of soft headgear and rigid helmets for a range of sports, including cricket (65), Australian football (38), soccer (44), and lacrosse (11), have been examined in this manner. Furthermore, biomechanical assessments have utilized accelerometry to provide insight into joint loads during physical activity (68), biomechanical factors that may predispose an individual to greater injury risk (41, 61), and the biomechanics of injured populations compared to non-injured populations (16).</p>
<p>Clearly, accelerometer use for investigating sport-related movements is varied and widespread, particularly within elite field team sport environments. Given the use of accelerometer technology for assessing physical demand in competitive team sports, with implications for the management of player wellbeing and subsequent performance, it is essential to determine the accuracy of the measurement tool itself. In order to confirm that such technology is valuable as a sports analysis tool, we must explore whether accelerometers provide a true measure of impacts by asking: how valid are accelerometers for quantifying short-duration, high-intensity efforts such as those that are commonly performed in sports? Specifically, how valid is accelerometer data when adhering to the way in which such monitors are set up and used in field team sports environments?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="accelerometer-validity-in-sport-settings" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Accelerometer validity in sport settings</h2>
<p>The literature examining accelerometer validity for measuring sport-related movements is limited. At the time of writing, only four published papers had investigated the criterion validity of accelerometers when quantifying such movements, of which three studies examined the relationship between force and acceleration (21, 25, 39), and the other investigated accelerometry in relation to optical motion analysis data (48).</p>
<div id="concurrent-validity" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> Concurrent validity</h3>
<p>In order to determine the accuracy of accelerometer data for quantifying impact events, the concurrent validity of the technology must be assessed. That is, the output of interest (in this case, accelerations measured by an accelerometer) must be compared to a “gold standard” or criterion measure (e.g., force) (56). A strong correlation and low error margin between these two variables thus establishes the validity of utilising acceleration data to quantify impact events.</p>
<p>At present, the literature is mixed in regards to the strength of any relationship between accelerometer data and force plate data. Janz et al. (39) observed no correlation between ground reaction forces (GRF) and activity counts during repeated drop jumping (r = -0.15). On the other hand, Garcia et al. (25) reported that summary activity count scores from all three accelerometers investigated (Mini-Motion Logger, Computer Sciences and Applications Inc. accelerometer, and BioTrainer) were moderately predictive of weight-adjusted vertical ground reaction force (VGRF), measured during a series of tasks including level-ground walking, running, continuous jumping, and drop landings (r = 0.46, 0.51, and 0.52, respective to each accelerometer model). Moreover, Elvin et al. (21) reported a strong correlation between peak GRF and peak tibial axial acceleration, measured during vertical jumps of easy (50% of maximum vertical jump height), moderate (75%), and challenging (95%) difficulty (average r2 = 0.812). These findings in particular suggest some promise for the use of accelerometers in measuring peak accelerations associated with impact events.</p>
<p>As aforementioned, only one study (48) has validated accelerometer data using motion capture acceleration data as the criterion measure. Using a portable system combining four pairs of uniaxial accelerometers with one rate gyroscope, Mayagoitia et al. (48) found strong correlations (coefficient of multiple correlations = 0.93-0.98) between the accelerometer data and accelerations calculated at the knee and shank from positional data. Despite some promising results, it is critical to note that, although these findings have been pooled for discussion in this review, making comparisons across these studies is difficult, due to considerable variations in methodology and data analysis, specifically in relation to 1) participant characteristics; 2) accelerometer placement; 3) setting, mode, duration and intensity of activity; and 4) data analysis procedures.</p>
<p>The participant characteristics of the study samples tested by Janz et al. (39) and Garcia et al. (25) were reasonably similar: both groups sampled children 6-11 years old, with almost equal representation of girls and boys. In contrast, both Elvin et al. (21) and Mayagoitia et al. (48) tested adult male participants. Accelerometer placement also varied, with Garcia et al. (25) and Janz et al. (39) attaching units at hip and waist sites, whereas Elvin et al. (21) aligned accelerometers with the fibular heads, while Mayagoitia et al. (48) used four uniaxial accelerometers arranged on the shank (lower leg) and thigh). Critically, these placement sites have limited relevance to accelerometer use in field team sports, as will be discussed in further detail below. Though each of these studies shared similarities in regards to the types of activities tested (e.g., jumping, walking, running), all three investigations varied considerably in their prescription of setting, mode, duration, or intensity of activity. For example, although both studies examined jumping tasks, Elvin et al. (21) examined moderate to high intensity countermovement jumps, while Garcia et al. (25) monitored continuous jumping activities performed in 1 min bouts. Similarly, although three studies (25, 39, 48) investigated accelerometer validity for quantifying locomotor activities, two studies (39, 48) employed treadmill-based locomotion into their protocol, while the other (25) implemented a circular, level-ground walking protocol. Furthermore, the data analysis strategies employed by these studies varied markedly. Only Elvin et al. (21) examined the relationship between peak VGRF and peak tibial axial accelerations, while the other three investigations (25, 39, 48) compared acceleration data in raw values or activity counts over short periods of time (1-3 minutes).</p>
<p>Many aspects of the field use of accelerometers in team sports are yet to be addressed by the validity literature. Therefore, the relevance of these findings to the application of accelerometers in sports performance analysis is debatable. As aforementioned, Elvin et al. (21) studied a sample population that may be comparable (recreational male athletes) to the elite athlete populations that are often instrumented with accelerometers in elite sport settings. However, the only high-intensity movement investigated thus far has been “challenging” vertical jumps (95% of maximum vertical jump height) (21); there is no published literature exploring the measurement of other common field team sport movements, such as sprinting, landing, or changes of direction. No studies have utilized accelerometers placed at the base of the neck, nor accelerometers that have been integrated with GPS units, both of which are commonly employed in elite sporting environments (9). Further, though impacts are of particular interest in team sport settings, only one study (21) has attempted to validate peak acceleration measures of team sport-related movements. Given the growing use of accelerometers for quantifying impact events, further inquiry is required to address the gaps in the existing body of knowledge regarding the accuracy of accelerometers. We must seek to answer the following question: do accelerometers provide a true measure of impact events that commonly occur in field team sports? It is essential that this broad question be explored in circumstances that are relevant to the context in which they are used, within the constraints of validity testing. Until the accuracy of accelerometer data is established, it remains difficult to draw appropriate conclusions regarding impacts based on acceleration data, as we cannot be sure that the accelerometers have collected true measures of these movement events.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Summary of main findings</h2>
<p>It is apparent that accelerometers provide a popular means to assess physical activity and sporting performance in the field. In physical activity research and interventions, accelerometry-based monitors are primarily used to estimate energy expenditure. On the other hand, accelerometers are often used in sports as an indirect measure of force during high intensity impact movements, usually occurring over a short period of time. Despite their pervasiveness in applied sports science and sports research, little is known about the validity of accelerometers in these settings. The current literature addressing the accelerometer accuracy for quantifying team sport-related movements is scarce, and is not externally valid to the application of such technology in team sport contexts. Further research is required to investigate the validity of accelerometers in the context of field team sports, for quantifying a wider range of team sport-related impact movements.</p>
