# Introduction and Statement of Problem

## Introduction
The application of accelerometers in sport and physical activity is widely reported and continues to grow rapidly. These devices are appealing for field use as they are small, lightweight, unobtrusive, provide a direct measure of accelerations in up to three directions, and can log data at high speed and store data over long periods of time (2, 21, 55).

Accelerometers are popular in physical activity interventions and research as they provide an objective measure of concurrent activity (2), allowing for the estimation of energy expenditure from recorded activity counts (12, 50). These monitors can also detect changes in duration and intensity of activity (25), and are capable of collecting and storing data over consecutive days (67). The use of accelerometers to estimate the energy cost of physical activity has been validated for level-ground and treadmill walking and running, but tends to be less accurate when assessing other lifestyle activities, such as those requiring predominantly upper body movements (73).

Increasingly, sports scientists are using accelerometers to assess sporting performance and physical demand (10), particularly in field team sports such as Australian football (10, 22), soccer (10), rugby union and rugby league (10, 35). Of particular interest in the team sport environment is the measurement of impacts (generally high-intensity movements or gameplay events involving a rapid change in acceleration). Accelerometers have also been used to measure injuries (8, 18, 32), test the quality of protective sporting equipment (11, 38, 65), and examine biomechanical movement patterns associated with physical activity (68), and prior injury (16). In these settings, accelerometers are used to provide an indirect measure of force, based on the relationship between force and acceleration as proposed by Newton’s Second Law of Motion (33). However, despite their popularity, relatively few studies (21, 25, 39) have examined the validity of accelerometers for quantifying sporting movements.

The current validation literature is scant, providing mixed support for accelerometer use as an indirect measure of impacts. The inconsistency across this body of research is primarily attributable to considerable differences in study design, including differences in participant characteristics, activities completed, accelerometer placement, and data analysis. Moreover, the scope of the literature in this area has limited relevance to the elite sports environment, as many of these factors are not representative of the manner in which accelerometers are used in field team sports. Further, a broad range of field team sports activities have yet to be investigated in relation to accelerometer validation.

Given that their use in elite field team sports continues to grow rapidly, more research is required to examine the validity of accelerometers as they are used in this context. This will allow us to answer the question, “How accurate is a triaxial accelerometer for quantifying field team sports movements?” Until it is established that accelerometers provide true and consistent measures when assessing sporting movements, we cannot confidently draw conclusions on the data collected in these circumstances.

## Aims

The aims of this study were:

1. To investigate the criterion validity of peak acceleration measures recorded by a triaxial accelerometer, using concurrently-measured peak force as the criterion measure, as assessed during team sport-related movement tasks.
2. To investigate criterion validity by comparing the peak acceleration measures recorded concurrently by a triaxial accelerometer and a high-speed infrared camera motion capture system, during team sport-related movement tasks.

This study examined one triaxial accelerometer that was integrated with Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. Specifically, a unit manufactured by GPSports (Canberra, Australia) was used, given the widespread use of these units in several elite field team sports (28).

## Hypotheses

1. Peak accelerometer values will correlate strongly (r > 0.80) with peak force values, for all movement tasks.
2. Peak accelerometer values will correlate strongly (r > 0.80) with peak marker acceleration values (calculated from positional data recorded in a motion capture laboratory), for all tasks.
3. With regards to marker accelerations as the criterion measures, the strongest correlations will be observed between peak accelerometer values and peak accelerations of the marker positioned on the shoulder harness (top [TOP] marker). Correlations between peak accelerometer values and the peak middle [MID, representing the pelvis] and bottom [BOT, representing the ankle] marker accelerations will be weaker.
